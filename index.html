							<p>I'm a twenty two year old senior student at <i><a href="https://www2.gmu.edu/" target="_blank">George Mason University</a></i>. I am completing a major in <strong>History</strong> while also working on a minor in <strong>Professional Writing</strong>.<br> I've always had an interest in researching the past and the different interpretations that arise from people studying it. I've developed an appreaciation for writing as well, and in doing so I have been trying to improve my writing in any way that I can.</p>

							<h3>Important Classes</h3>
							<section>
							<h4>HISTORY 125</h4>
							<p>A basic class, but one that teaches students how to absorb and process a vast amount of information. Helpful in any situation.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
							<h4>HISTORY 300</h4>
							<p>A class dedicated to teaching students how to find and properly cite primary sources. I focused my time here on researching the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upward_Bound"target="_blank">Upward Bound</a> program at George Mason, going through many files and books to do so.</p>
					        </section>
							<section>
							<h4>HISTORY 499</h4>
							<p>The most difficult history class at Mason. It taught me how to create a coherent paper after going through countless sources and tying them together into a cohesive narrative.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
							<h4>ENGLISH 386</h4>
							<p>A class that taught me how to edit many different documents, from research papers to websites. It also taught me efficent ways to research unfamiliar topics in order to present information to a wider audience.</p>
	                        </section>
                            <aside>
							<h4>Mindful Living LLC</h4>
							<p>A community that I am proud to have been a part of. This LLC teaches students how to properly balance their work and private lives, making sure we get the greatest amount of work done without damage to our mental health.</p>

								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="picture.jpg" alt="" /></a>

							<p>I would be lying if I said that I considered my life to be unique or special. I have two older sisters, and we all live comfortably because of my parents' hard work. My family are immigrants from the Republic of Georgia, having moved to the United States a few years before I was born. My parents always wanted great things for me, and they always tried to make me study hard in order to be successful. I wish I could say that I always followed their advice, but as a child and a teenager I struggled to be the son that I wanted to be, and it wouldn't be until college that I understood why.<br>
During my sophomore year at George Mason University, I learned that I had depression and untreated ADD. I took a semester off in order to get the therapy I needed for both conditions, and came back to college more prepared then ever. With a clearer mind and more determined than ever, I started doing much better in all of my <em>classes</em>, finally achieving the grades that I wanted. I became more invested in my major, and through my desire to learn more about writing, I took a minor in the subject to learn topics that I never would have otherwise. All of which has made me wonder about my future, and the type of job that I would like to take. I know that I enjoy writing and researching, and I want to see what sort of work I can get that involves both of those skills.
As I've said before, I don't find myself to be particularly unique. However, I do think that I have skills that would work in many fields, and I want the opportunity to use my abilities to help others. I hope that what I have here is sufficent for others to see what I have to offer.</p>
